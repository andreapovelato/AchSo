The main resources that Ach So! produces are Annotated videos. 


Annotated videos are composed of Video files, Annotations, Metadata and Thumbnails.

Annotated videos come from three sources: 
    1) they are created on a device around a Video file created by device's recorder app. In this case the exact format of the Video file, resolution etc. depend on the device and its recorder app. This process is launched by user by 'Recording a new video'
    2) they are rebuilt based on data retrieved from device's Local storage (SQL database). Video file itself and Thumbnails are not in the database, but in devices' media files. Database stores a reference to them.
    3) they are created from a xml data received from server. The xml contains descriptions of the Metadata, Annotations and references to Video file and Thumbnail files in the server. This happens as a result from server queries, server responds to search and browse queries by providing the xml and Ach So! creates Annotated video objects from them.


Video files
    Video file is a part of Annotated video.
    these are raw or packed video files that we try to operate on as high level as possible -- we don't care about their format etc. we just receive them, play them, and send them to server in format that is device's preferred format. Video file's own metadata fields are not used, when it exists only locally, it is managed by Android's media storage and has path and id relative to that. When it is sent to server it will be processed by ClViTra2.0 and an URI for remote video file is returned. This will be used if local file is not available.


Metadata
    Annotated video metadata is a collection of metadata that is used by Ach So! It is limited to those fields that are both a) necessary for navigation and user interface b) make sense for user. As far as possible they should be derivative and autogenerated from recording environment and not asked from user. 

    id

    Thumbnails
        Thumbnails (micro- and mini-) are part of Annotated video metadata.  
        Thumbnails are originally generated by Android media services and they are local path URIs. When they are received from server, they are just URIs to image files.
